# Employee-Template

This app builds basic profiles about each member of your team. To begin, you will need to install the dependencies, then run app.js in your terminal. 

First, you will be prompted for information about your manger, after which you can enter information about your interns and engineers. When you select quit, an index.html file will be created which displays all of this information. 

You can view a demonstration of the testing and running of this application on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/1gp6-HPg3Kk)
